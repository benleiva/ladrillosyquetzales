  The formula for d is: $$d = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma}$$
  
  The formula for Z is: $$Z = \frac{M - \mu}{\sigma_M}$$
  
  The code to use MOTE in R is: 
  
```{r help, echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}
source("output_functions.R")
library(knitr)
library(MOTE)
saved = help_console(d.z.mean, "html", before = "", after = "")
```

`r paste(saved[-c(1:8)], collapse = " ")`
